### Modify a Purchase Bill:
```bash
PUT /api/v1/purchase/bills/1?company_id=1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "supplier_id": 5,
  "items": [...],
  "grand_total": 1500.00
}
```

### Delete a Purchase Bill:

## 🔒 Security & Permissions

- `purchases.view` - View and check usage
- `purchases.edit` - Modify bills
- `purchases.delete` - Delete bills
- `sales.view` - View and check usage
- `sales.edit` - Modify invoices
- `sales.delete` - Delete invoices
- **Admin role** - Can override date restrictions

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Usage Tracking**: Once items are used in POS/Sales, the bill becomes locked automatically
2. **Date Restrictions**: Only admins can modify bills from previous days
3. **Status Check**: Sales invoices must be in draft/confirmed status to be modified
4. **Atomic Operations**: All modifications are wrapped in database transactions
5. **Audit Trail**: All changes are tracked with user ID and timestamp

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. **Database Migration**: Run migration to add new columns to production database
2. **Update Existing Records**: Run script to check and mark existing bills
3. **Frontend Integration**: Update UI to use new endpoints
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all scenarios
5. **User Training**: Train users on new functionality

## 🎯 Business Value

### Problems Solved:
✅ **Wrong Bill Entry**: Users can now correct mistakes in bills
✅ **Wrong Item Entry**: Users can modify individual items  
✅ **Delete Incorrect Bills**: Users can delete bills created by mistake
